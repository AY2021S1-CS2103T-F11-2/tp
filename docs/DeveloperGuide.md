## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#modelPerson-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storagePerson-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` in the deliverable, meeting, or person mode.

![`Architecture Sequence Diagram with Dashboard](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramWithDb.png)

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramUpdated.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonDetailsPanel`, `CalendarListPanel`,
 `ProjectCompletionStatusPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.


 The `Dashboard` components of the UI are displayed when the application is in `Dashboard` mode. The left side of the application consists of 
 the `ProjectCompletionStatusPanel` where the user can see the overall completion status of his/her product based on the
 percentage of deliverables completed. The right side consists of the `CalendarListPanel` which displays a list of deliverables
 and meetings, through `CalendarDeliverableCard` and `CalendarMeetingCard` respectively, in chronological order so that the user can
 keep track of his/her schedule.


 When the application is in deliverable, meeting or contact mode, the respective UI components will be displayed. For example,
 in deliverable mode, the left side of the application will contain the `DeliverableListPanel`, consisting of `DeliverableCard`,
 to show the list of deliverables the user has. The right side consists of the `DeliverableDetailsPanel` which will display the full details
 of the deliverable that the user is viewing or just performed an operation on. The same idea is applicable for meeting and contact mode.
  

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`ModelDeliverable.java`, `ModelMeeting.java`, `ModelPerson.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/modelPerson/Model.java)

The Model component (`ModelDeliverable`, `ModelMeeting` or `ModelPerson`),

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores its respective deliverable, meeting, or contact book. 
* exposes unmodifiable its respective `ObservableList<Deliverable>`,`ObservableList<Meeting>`, or `ObservableList<Person>`.
e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storagePerson/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### [In Progress] \[DateTime\]

#### Proposed Implementation
The implementation allows users to parse and compare unique DateTime types. 

To parse, DateTime should be in the following format: **`dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm`** 
* Single digits fields must include leading zero: `01-01-0101 01:10`.
* Valid Calendar Range: \[`01-01-0001 00:00` - `31-12-9999 23:59`\].

DateTime will throw a parsing error if
* `1-10-2020 00:00:59` Format is wrong (e.g missing or additional digit).
* `31-02-2020 00:00` Invalid range (e.g invalid leap year).

The following is an example of how DateTime can be implemented into the model

![DateTimeClassDiagram](images/DateTimeClass.png)
* DateTime is a class that can be used by all models.
* From, To and Deadline are fields which extend from DateTime.

DateTime can be used to compare with other DateTime objects:
* Enable deliverables to be sorted based on which one is due the earliest.
* DateTime can be used to identify time clashes between different meetings.

#### Design consideration:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Throws error when invalid range is 
given for dates
  * E.g `29-02-2019` or `31-11-2020`.
  * Pros: Notifies user he has made a mistake.
  * Cons: Costs time to re-type the entire command.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Command knows how to resolve overflow of dates. 
    * E.g `29-02-2019` will be resolved automatically to `28-02-2019` the `MAX number of days of the month`.
    * Pros: Saves time for the user if he had intended to select the last day of the month.
    * Cons: The date specified may not be the intended input.

### Auto-sort feature

#### Implementation

The Auto-sort feature allows users to view `Deliverable`s, `Meeting`s, and `Person`s in a logical manner. 
Specifically, the Auto-sort feature automatically sorts `Deliverable`s, `Meeting`s, and `Person`s by the following attributes: 

* `Meeting`   - its `From`'s `LocalDateTime` value in ascending chronological order 
* `Deliverable`  - its `Deadline`'s `LocalDateTime` value in ascending chronological order 
* `Person`   - its `Name`'s `String` value in ascending alphabetical order 

Auto-sort is facilitated by custom classes that implements `Comparator`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a list is auto-sorted upon an addition of a `Meeting`.

![AutosortSequenceDiagram](images/AutosortSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How auto-sorting executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts a list upon an addition or update of an element.
    * Pros: Error-free and easy to implement.
    * Cons: Relatively high time complexity i.e. O(nlogn).
* **Alternative 2:** Searches the correct index in the list to insert an element upon addition or update.
    * Pros: Relatively low time complexity i.e. O(logn).
    * Cons: Prone to error and difficult to implement.
    
### Calendar feature

#### Implementation

The Calendar feature allows users to view their `Deliverable`s and`Meeting`s together in one chronologically ordered list - `calendarList`. 
Specifically, the Calendar feature combines and orders `Deliverable`s and `Meeting`s by the following attributes: 

* `Meeting`   - its `From`'s `LocalDateTime` value 
* `Deliverable`  - its `Deadline`'s `LocalDateTime` value

The combining is done by applying polymorphism; `Deliverable` and `Meeting` implement the interface `TimeEvent`.
The following class diagram demonstrates the above-mentioned polymorphism. 
![TimeEventClassDiagram](images/TimeEventClassDiagram.png)

Meanwhile, the ordering is facilitated by the [Auto-sort feature](#auto-sort-feature).

The following sequence diagram shows how the Calendar is updated upon an addition of a `Deliverable`.

![CalendarSequenceDiagram](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Where and how is `calendarList` updated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `calendarList` is in the UI component, and for any change in `UniqueDeliverableList`'s or `UniqueMeetingList`'s `internalList`: 
  1. `calendarList` is cleared 
  1. both `internalList`s' elements are added into `calendarList`
  1. `calendarList` is sorted
    * Pros: Coupling is reduced as the implementation of `UniqueDeliverableList` and `UniqueMeetingList` are unmodified.
    * Cons: Relatively high time complexity as any update to the `internalList`s requires clearing, adding back all `internalList`s' elements, and sorting `calendarList`. 
    This is required because `calendarList`, which is not in `UniqueDeliverableList` and `UniqueMeetingList`, has no direct access to the item being updated. 
* **Alternative 2:** `calendarList` is in `UniqueDeliverableList` and `UniqueMeetingList` as references, and for any change in `UniqueDeliverableList`'s or `UniqueMeetingList`'s `internalList`: 
  1. `calendarList` is updated in the same way as the `internalList` involved. 
  This is possible because the `calendarList`, which is in `UniqueDeliverableList` and `UniqueMeetingList`, has direct access to the element being updated. 
    * Pros: Lower time complexity compared to Alternative 1, as both clearing and adding back all `internalList`s' elements are not needed. 
    * Cons: Coupling is increased as the implementation of `UniqueDeliverableList` and `UniqueMeetingList` are modified
    i.e. both hold and update `calendarList` (on top of `internalList`) for any update.

### Done feature

#### Implementation

The Done feature allows users to mark their deliverables as completed. 

1. The user input is received by `MainWindow` in the `UI` component before being passed to `DeliverableLogicManager` to be executed. 
1. `DeliverableLogicManager` will call `DeliverableBookParser` which will parse the command keyword ("done") to return a `DoneCommandParser`. 
1. `DoneCommandParser` will then parse the command argument to return a `DoneCommand`.
1. On execution, `DoneCommand` will set the status of the specified deliverable to completed and update the `ModelDeliverable` accordingly. 

Invalid user inputs such as an invalid index will result in the appropriate error messages displayed to the user.

Given below is a sequence diagram to show how the done operation works at each step.

![DoneCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DoneCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How `done` is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a separate command `done` for marking deliverables as completed.
    * Pros: Clearer and easier for the user. Prevents the `edit` command from being too cluttered with too many
    editable fields.
    * Cons: More code and testing required as there are additional classes created such as `DoneCommand` and 
    `DoneCommandParser`.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to mark deliverables as completed through the existing `edit` command by changing 
the completion status field of the deliverable
    * Pros: Less code required since we only need to make small amendments to the existing `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`.
    * Cons: Format of the command will be more complex and confusing for the user. Instead of just having to pass in the index
    of deliverable, we will need to provide a prefix (e.g. s/) and a string to represent the completion status to edit to (e.g. edit 1 s/complete).

### Switch Mode feature

Productiv can be in any one of these modes: dashboard, deliverable, meeting and contact mode.
Based on the current mode, user input is passed to the corresponding `LogicManager`,
e.g. if the user is in deliverable mode, user input is passed to `LogicDeliverableManager`.

#### Implementation

The user input is handled and retrieved by the `MainWindow` and then passed to `LogicModeManager`.
`LogicModeManager` will call `ModeParser`, which will create a `SwitchCommandParser`.
`ModeParser` calls on `SwitchCommandParser` to parse the arguments in the user input.
`SwitchCommandParser` will parse the arguments and return a `SwitchCommand`.
This `SwitchCommand` is passed back `LogicModeManager`.
`LogicModeManager` will then call the execute method of `SwitchCommand` which returns a `CommandResult` containing the mode that the app should switch to.
This `CommandResult` is passed back `MainWindow`.
Then, `MainWindow` will then call the `getMode()` method of `CommandResult` to gets the new mode to switch to.
Based on the mode, `MainWindow` will update its own attribute `mode`.
`MainWindow` will then update the UI via `switchMode(mode)` to only show information related to the new mode.

For the command, a `SwitchCommandParser` is implemented to parse the input into a mode.
Invalid arguments (any argument other than `dv`, `db`, `m` and `c`) are also handled properly, with suitable error messages being displayed to the user.

Given below is a sequence diagram to show how the switch mode mechanism behaves.

![SwitchModeSequenceDiagram](images/SwitchModeSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an activity diagram to show how the switch mode operation works.

![SwitchModeActivityDiagram](images/SwitchModeActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Switch commands should be implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Shortened user commands: `switch` `db`, `dv`, `m` or `c`.
  * Pros: More convenient and faster to type shorter user commands.
  * Cons: More difficult for users to remember short forms.

* **Alternative 2 (original implementation):** Longer user commands: `switch` `dashboard`, `deliverable`, `meeting` or `contact`.
  * Pros: Clearer as commands correspond to the naming of tabs on the navigation bar.
  * Cons: Takes longer to type longer user commands.

##### Aspect: Where mode is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store mode in `MainWindow`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle.

* **Alternative 2:** Store mode in a `LogicModeManager`.
  * Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle better.
  * Cons: `LogicModeManager` would need to have references to the other logic managers. 
  It should not be the responsibility of `LogicModeManager` to pass the user input to the relevant `LogicManager`.


### View feature

#### Implementation

The view feature allows users to view the details of a specific deliverable, meeting or contact on the right
panel of the display window, depending on the mode the application is in. 

1. Suppose the user in currently in the meeting mode, the user input received by `MainWindow` in `UI` component will be passed to `MeetingLogicManager` to be executed. 
1. `MeetingLogicManager` will call `MeetingBookParser` which will parse the command keyword ("view") to return a `ViewCommandParser`. 
1. `ViewCommandParser` will then parse the command argument to return a `ViewCommand`.
1. On execution, `ViewCommand` will update the `ModelMeeting` to set the meeting currently in view. 
1. `UI` component will then make a separate call to `ModelMeeting` to retrieve the meeting currently in view and display its full details to the user in the right panel of the application.

Invalid user inputs such as an invalid index will result in the appropriate error messages displayed to the user. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works in each step:

![ViewCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How view executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the item in view inside the respective model.
  * Pros: Ensures persistence as it can be referred to repeatedly.
  * Cons: Requires another operation to fetch the item in view to be displayed.

* **Alternative 2:** Passes the item in view inside the Command Result to the UI component
  * Pros: Does not require an additional operation to fetch the item in view.
  * Cons: Cluttering of Command Result object which now needs to store mode-specific items. This is against its original purpose 
  which is to pass mode-neutral information, such as error messages, back to UI for display after a command execution.

### \[Proposed\] Overall Completion Percentage feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The Overall Completion Percentage (OCP) feature is to be implemented in the Dashboard page (coming soon) of *Productiv*.
This feature allows users to have a quick overview of the progress of their product's development. OCP is given by the 
formula*:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
**_OCP (%) = Number of Completed Deliverables / Total Number of Deliverables Ã— 100_**
</div>

\* If no deliverables are present, OCP will be set to **0%**.

The OCP will only be updated upon successful execution of the following (simplified) commands:
* AddCommand, i.e. *add(deliverable)*
* DoneCommand, i.e. *done(deliverable)*
* DeleteCommand, i.e. *delete(deliverable)*

The following proposed sequence diagram shows how the updating of the OCP would be implemented:

![OCPSequenceDiagram](images/OCPSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How updating of OCP executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the deliverable counters within `LogicDeliverableManager`.
    * Pros: Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle.
    * Cons: May require additional interfaces/methods to retrieve the required values for OCP computation.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the deliverable counters as global variables.
    * Pros: Directly accesses the required values for OCP computation.
    * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle.

## **Appendix F: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing. Each test case is to be executed independently of each other.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Test case: Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder. Double-click the jar file.<br>
       Expected: Shows the GUI with a dashboard containing some sample data. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Test case: Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
       Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

       <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The window has a minimum width and height so that the UI does not look so cramped.
       </div>

1. Shutting down

    1. Test case: Click the window close button.<br>
       Expected: The app shuts down.

    1. Test case: `exit`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Switching Modes

1. Switching to deliverable mode

    1. Prerequisite: You are not in deliverable mode.

    1. Test case: Click `Deliverable` on the top navigation bar.<br>
       Expected: Window displays list of saved deliverables.

    1. Test case: `switch dv`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

    1. Other incorrect switch commands to try: `switch meeting`, `switch dev`<br>
       Expected: Status bar throws error message.

### Adding a deliverable

1. Adding Login screen

   1. Prerequisites: You are in deliverable mode. Login screen not already added. If added, delete it.

   1. Test case: `add t/Login screen m/1.0 by/12-12-2020 23:59 d/Must include username and password fields c/John Martin, Abby Li`<br>
      Expected: Login screen to appear in the list of deliverables and expanded in right panel.

   1. Test case: `add t/Login screen`<br>
      Expected: No deliverable is added. Status bar throws error message.

   1. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add Login screen` <br>
      Expected: Status bar throws error message.

### Saving data

1. Deliverables, meetings and contacts are saved automatically to ./data/.

   On normal usage, 3 JSON files are created / saved - `deliverablebook.json`, `meetingbook.json` and `contactbook.json`.
   All 3 files contain information stored by the user from their respective modes.

   On first starting the program, a file is only created if the user inputs a command specific to that mode.

   1. Prerequisites: Very first time using the app.

   1. Test case: Start and close the app immediately.<br>
      Expected: The 3 JSON files are not created.

   1. Test case: Start the app. Switch to deliverable mode. Add a deliverable. Close the app.<br>
      Expected: Of the 3 JSON files, only `deliverablebook.json` created.

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Test case: Delete `deliverablebook.json` file. Start the app. Switch to deliverable mode. Enter `list`. Close the app.<br>
      Expected: `deliverablebook.json` should re-initialise a list of sample deliverables.

   1. Test case: Corrupt `deliverablebook.json` under ./data/. Add a (`-`) to a saved deliverable's milestone.<br>
      Expected: The app should be able to start up but show no deliverables.

      <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** To re-initialise a list of sample deliverables, execute the previous test case.
      </div>

**Understanding our target user profile**

Initially, we had completely different ideas on what our target user profile is. We were confused about the differences between product owners, product managers, business analysts and project leads.

To ensure that we were all on the same page, we made sure to talk things out before starting our project. We researched on the job scope of a product manager and shared with each other our experiences of working in different organisations and what product managers do at these organisations. 

Eventually, our shared understanding on our target user profile helped us to build a cohesive product catered to product managers.


**Model**

The `Model` of Productiv is certainly more complex than that of AddressBook. In AddressBook, there was only one key entity type in play - `Person`. For Productiv, three different entity types are managed at once - `Deliverable`, `Meeting` and `Contact`.

As such, we had to restructure our entire application to accommodate these three entity types. Throughout the project, we had to rethink and refactor the structure of our code, weighing the pros and cons of each approach. This was a very painful process and also vulnerable to regressions.

Eventually, we separated the models into three different `ModelManager`s, handled by three different `LogicManager`s, adhering to the Separation of Concerns Principle. The reduced coupling decreased the dependencies between the models.

This also influenced our decision to not link the `Contacts` field in `Deliverable` and `Meeting` to data in the `Contact` model. This also provided greater flexibility to users as they could add contacts to `Deliverable`s and `Meeting`s without recording the details of the contact, e.g. a `Meeting` can involve people who are not important to record as a `Contact`.


**Ui**

The `Ui` of Productiv was almost entirely revamped from the AddressBook. 

The easiest way would have been to stick to the current `Ui` of the AddressBook i.e. have 3 lists (`DeliverableListPanel`, `MeetingListPanel` and `ContactListPanel`) on the same page. While this would have been easier to implement, it would have made Productiv look very cluttered. We chose the hard way as we believe in making the user-experience seamless and enjoyable. As such, we worked hard to have the `Ui` change according to the current mode the user is in and also create an entirely new View Panel to enhance the user experience.

The `Dashboard` was difficult to implement. In particular, the OCP was definitely not something that could be done overnight. None of us had experience with JavaFX prior to CS2103T. We did extensive research on the libraries that we could use and exhaustive checks to ensure that the OCP was synced with the rest of Productiv. Eventually, we managed to create the OCP, which vastly improved the user experience.


**Overall**

As a whole, this process was fraught with challenges. Whenever we had to face obstacles, we worked with each other to brainstorm and decide on the best solution. We made sure that everyone followed the same workflow and reviewed each otherâ€™s work to maintain the code quality of our codebase. We have learnt alot from each other, beyond just technical skills. Productiv would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the entire team.
