## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#modelPerson-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storagePerson-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/modelPerson/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) modelPerson is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storagePerson/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### [In Progress] \[DateTime\]

#### Proposed Implementation
The implementation allows users to parse and compare unique DateTime types. 

To parse, DateTime should be in the following format: **`dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm`** 
* Single digits fields must include leading zero: `01-01-0101 01:10`.
* Valid Calendar Range: \[`01-01-0001 00:00` - `31-12-9999 23:59`\].

DateTime will throw a parsing error if
* `1-10-2020 00:00:59` Format is wrong (e.g missing or additional digit).
* `31-02-2020 00:00` Invalid range (e.g invalid leap year).

The following is an example of how DateTime can be implemented into the model

![DateTimeClassDiagram](images/DateTimeClass.png)
* DateTime is a class that can be used by all models.
* From, To and Deadline are fields which extend from DateTime.

DateTime can be used to compare with other DateTime objects:
* Enable deliverables to be sorted based on which one is due the earliest.
* DateTime can be used to identify time clashes between different meetings.

#### Design consideration:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Throws error when invalid range is 
given for dates
  * E.g `29-02-2019` or `31-11-2020`.
  * Pros: Notifies user he has made a mistake.
  * Cons: Costs time to re-type the entire command.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Command knows how to resolve overflow of dates. 
    * E.g `29-02-2019` will be resolved automatically to `28-02-2019` the `MAX number of days of the month`.
    * Pros: Saves time for the user if he had intended to select the last day of the month.
    * Cons: The date specified may not be the intended input.

### \[Proposed\] Autosort feature

#### Proposed Implementation

Autosort allows users to view `Meeting`s, `Deliverable`s, and `Contact`s in a logical manner. Specifically, Autosort
automatically sorts the abovementioned components by the following attributes: 

* `Meeting`   - `From`'s `LocalDateTime` value in chronological order 
* `Deadline`  - `Deadline`'s `LocalDateTime` value in chronological order 
* `Contact`   - `Title`'s `String` value in alphabetical order 

Autosort is faciliated by custom objects that implements `Comparator`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a list is autosorted upon an addition of a new element.

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/AutosortSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How autosorting executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts a list upon an addition or update of an element.
    * Pros: Error-free and easy to implement.
    * Cons: Relatively high time complexity i.e. O(nlogn).
* **Alternative 2:** Searches the correct index in the list to insert an element upon addition or update.
    * Pros: Relatively low time complexity i.e. O(logn).
    * Cons: Prone to error and difficult to implement.

### [In progress] Switch Mode feature

#### Implementation

Productiv can be in different modes: dashboard, deliverable, meeting and contact mode. 
Based on the current mode, the user input is passed to the relevant `LogicManager`. 
Following that, the `LogicManager` will parse the user input and produce the relevant results.
The current mode is represented by a `ModeEnum` and stored in `MainWindow`.

![SwitchModeSequenceDiagram](images/SwitchModeSequenceDiagram.png)
Figure <?> Switch Command Sequence Diagram (In Progress)

The user input is passed to `LogicModeManager`. 
`LogicModeManager` then returns a `CommandResult` containing the mode that Productiv should switch to. 
`MainWindow` then reflects the corresponding list in the user interface and
will pass subsequent user inputs to the corresponding `LogicManager`.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Where mode is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store mode in `MainWindow`
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle.

* **Alternative 2:** Store mode in a `LogicModeManager`
  * Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle better.
  * Cons: `LogicModeManager` would need to have references to the other logic managers. 
  It should not be the responsibility of `LogicModeManager` to pass the user input to the relevant `LogicManager`.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] View feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The view feature allows users to view the details of a specific `Meeting`, `Deliverable` or `Contact` on the right
panel of the display window.

The proposed view mechanism is facilitated by implementing the following operations:

* `ModelDeliverable#setDeliverableInView()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the `Deliverable` to be displayed
* `ModelPerson#setContactInView()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the `Contact` to be displayed
* `ModelMeeting#setMeetingInView()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the `Meeting` to be displayed

Given below is an example usage scenario of how viewing a deliverable works.

Step 1. The user executes `view 2` command to view the details of the second deliverable in the list of deliverables. The view command calls `ModelDeliverable#setDeliverableInView()` which updates the deliverable currently in view in the `ModelDeliverable`. This newly updated deliverable is then fetched and displayed to the user on the right panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

![ViewCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How view executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the item in view inside the respective model.
  * Pros: Ensures persistence as it can be referred to repeatedly.
  * Cons: Requires another operation to fetch the item in view to be displayed.

* **Alternative 2:** Passes the item in view inside the Command Result to the UI component
  * Pros: Does not require an additional operation to fetch the item in view.
  * Cons: Inappropriate use of Command Result whose primary objective is to pass feedback to the user.

### \[Proposed\] Overall Completion Percentage feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The Overall Completion Percentage (OCP) feature is to be implemented in the Dashboard page (coming soon) of *Productiv*.
This feature allows users to have a quick overview of the progress of their product's development. OCP is given by the 
formula*:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
**_OCP (%) = Number of Completed Deliverables / Total Number of Deliverables Ã— 100_**
</div>

\* If no deliverables are present, OCP will be set to **0%**.

The OCP will only be updated upon successful execution of the following (simplified) commands:
* AddCommand, i.e. *add(deliverable)*
* DoneCommand, i.e. *done(deliverable)*
* DeleteCommand, i.e. *delete(deliverable)*

The following proposed sequence diagram shows how the updating of the OCP would be implemented:

![OCPSequenceDiagram](images/OCPSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How updating of OCP executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the deliverable counters within `LogicDeliverableManager`.
    * Pros: Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle.
    * Cons: May require additional interfaces/methods to retrieve the required values for OCP computation.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the deliverable counters as global variables.
    * Pros: Directly accesses the required values for OCP computation.
    * Cons: May violate Single Responsibility Principle.

## **Appendix D: Non-Functional Requirements**

1. Should work on any [`mainstream OS`](#common-classes) as long as it has Java `11` installed.
1. Should be able to hold up to 1000 deliverables, 1000 meetings and 1000 contacts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
1. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse. This excludes the Switch and Help command.
1. The user interface should look intuitive and simple to navigate. It should not look cluttered with too many panels.
1. The application should be for a single user, with its size being smaller than 100MB.
1. The computer should have sufficient disk space to accommodate the userâ€™s data stored in the system.
1. The computer should have sufficient RAM and CPU power to run the JVM smoothly.

## **Appendix E: Glossary**

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.
* **Deliverable**: a thing able to be provided, especially as a product of a development process.
* **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update and delete.

## **Appendix F: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file.<br>
       Expected: Shows the GUI with a dashboard containing some sample data. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.<br>
       Note: The window has a minimum width and height so that the UI does not look so cramped.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Shutting down

    1. Test case: Click the window close button.<br>
       Expected: The app shuts down.

    1. Test case: `exit`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Switching Modes

1. Switching to deliverable mode

    1. Prerequisite: You are not in deliverable mode.

    1. Test case: Click `Deliverable` on the top navigation bar.<br>
       Expected: Window displays list of saved deliverables.

    1. Test case: `switch dv`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

    1. Other incorrect switch commands to try: `switch me3ting`, `switch dev`<br>
       Expected: Status bar throws error message.

### Adding a deliverable

1. Adding Login screen

   1. Prerequisites: You are in deliverable mode. Login screen not already added. If added, delete it.

   1. Test case: `add t/Login screen m/1.0 by/12-12-2020 23:59 d/Must include username and password fields c/John Martin, Abby Li`<br>
      Expected: Login screen to appear in the list of deliverables and expanded in right panel.

   1. Test case: `add t/Login screen`<br>
      Expected: No deliverable is added. Status bar throws error message.

   1. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add Login screen` <br>
      Expected: Status bar throws error message.

### Saving data

1. Deliverables, meetings and contacts are saved automatically to ./data/.

   On normal usage, 3 JSON files are created:
      * `contactbook.json`
      * `meetingbook.json`
      * `deliverablebook.json`

   All 3 files contain information stored by the user from their respective modes.

   On first starting the program, a file is only created if the user inputs a command specific to that mode.

   1. Prerequisites: Very first time using the app.

   1. Test case: Starting and close the app immediately.<br>
      Expected: No JSON files created.

   1. Test case: Start the app. Switch to deliverable mode. Add a deliverable. Close the app.
      Expected: Only `deliverablebook.json` created.

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Test case: Delete `deliverablebook.json` file and start the jar file again<br>
      Expected: Data file should re-initialise a list of sample deliverables

   1. Test case: Corrupt `deliverablebook.json` under ./data/. The easiest way is to add - to a saved deliverable's milestone.
      Expected: Similar to previous.
