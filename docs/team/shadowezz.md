## Project: Productiv

Productiv is a one-stop desktop app for product managers like yourself to organise your contacts, deliverables and 
meetings, so that you can track your productâ€™s development easily. 

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to complete deliverables.
  * What it does: This allows the user to mark specific deliverables as completed after accomplishing them.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing user to keep track of the completion status of different deliverables and 
  focus on those that are not completed yet.
  * Highlights: This enhancement is used to display the project completion percentage in the dashboard (implemented by Gabriel) so 
  that the user can have a big picture of the progress of his/her product.
